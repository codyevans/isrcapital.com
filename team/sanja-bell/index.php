					As ISRC’s Executive Assistant, Sanja Bell is in charge of keeping the trains running on time. She came to Boise (and ISRC) via Amman, Jordan where she refined her negotiation skills in the local souks and was active in the diplomatic community. Prior to joining ISR Capital, Sanja worked as a newspaper editor, radio host, communications consultant and journalist reporting on Central European affairs, and as a key team member advising senior Serbian leaders. Sanja received a Bachelor’s degree in Communications in her native Belgrade, Serbia, and is also just a few credits shy of receiving her second Bachelor’s degree in Journalism.
