					Cody joined the ISR Capital team in 2011 and came equipped with a diverse set of skills and a B.F.A. in Graphic Design from Boise State University. As ISR Capitalâ€™s in-house graphic designer, Cody is responsible for all things visual. He can be found working on projects that involve print design, motion design, web design and illustration. However, his specialty is turning pixels to code with his knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
