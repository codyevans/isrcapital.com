			<p class="introSub">Junior or micro mines are under served and todays market conditions 
			create a tremendous opportunity for a well-funded organization like ISR and its affiliates 
			to acquire junior gold mines and to quickly move them into production. Even if the majors 
			would be able to move their larger gold projects into production within the next 2-3 years, 
			there would still be a significant imbalance in the supply and demand of gold and investors 
			would continue to hedge on gold with the current economic climate.
			</p>
			<p>
			ISR’s philosophy is to focus on mining ore deposits, and sustainable job creation, 
			by adopting economically profitable mining techniques “micro-mining" which involve the following aspects:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Utilizing our network of Strategic partners and affiliates to acquire near term production properties. 
				Smaller gold deposits the majors drilled out and passed on due to small size of deposit typically under 1 mill. Ounces  au equivalent. 
				</li>
				<li>
				Environmental stewardship with a much smaller footprint and impact to the local environment.
				</li>
				<li>
				Ensuring that financial resources for the mines operations continues for the long-term.
				</li>
				<li>
				Smaller workforces that depend on local residents and providing long-term economic benefits to the surrounding communities.
				</li>
				<li>
				Evaluating upside potential by funding exploration in our area of interest. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Historically, many juniors have been reluctant to adopt this type of approach. 
			One of the key reasons for this is their exit strategy has been to build a mining 
			project that they can sell to a major, or just sell stock with hype.  However, ISR’s 
			objective is to build a sustainable source of income.  The relatively low cost of micro 
			mining means significantly lower capital requirements, concentrating on identified economic 
			niches means quick positive cash flow.  The Company's focus on targeting existing mining operations
			will further accelerate our ability to generate positive cash flow.

			Below is a quick snapshot of some projects ISR has vetted, funded, acquired, or joint ventured on.

			<h3 class="portfolio1">Idaho</h3>
			<h3>Quartzburg Gold</h3>
			<div class="boxSub1isrc">
				<p class="first">
				In The Quartzburg Mining District  in the Boise Basin, is historically one of the most 
				significant districts in the State of Idaho. Between 1863 and 1955 over 3,000,000 
				ounces of gold has been produced in the Boise Basin. Quartzburg contains the 3 
				notable gold producers Gold Hill, Belshazzar and Mountain Chief Mines
				</p>
				</div>
			<h3>Gold Hill</h3>
			<div class="boxSubMiddle">
				<p class="initial">
				Since Gold Hill's discovery in August of 1863, the Gold Hill Mine was the deepest highest
				producing and longest producing underground gold mines in Idaho until the turn of the century. 
				Gold Hill Mine is located on the north rim of the Boise Basin within the Quartzburg 
				Mining District.The mine was developed through two shafts, the Gold Hill Shaft and the Pioneer shaft, where mining was 
				concentrated along high angle veins and shears associated with a larger mineralized system transecting
				nearly 130 miles through central Idaho known as the Trans-Challis Fault System. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The Gold Hill Mine and the Quartzburg District are located approximately three miles 
				west of Placerville, ID and approximately 35 miles northeast of Boise. The mine produced 
				in excess of 450,000 oz. of gold from the Gold Hill and Pioneer shafts from 1863 to 1938.
				GHRMC is currently producing concentrates from processed on surface ore. Number 1 concentrates
				are very high grade in Gold, and being smelted by Essential Metals in Northern Idaho.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Belshazzar</h3>
			<div class="boxSubMiddle">
				<p class="initial">
				Revealing itself in the upper reaches of Fall Creek, Belshazzar Mine resides in a tributary to the Granite
				Creek sub-drainage, approximately 1.75 miles southwest of the Quartzburg Mining District.  
				It is on strike with the same mineralization as the Gold Hill Mine Veins.  It is 4.3 miles west of 
				Placerville, Idaho. Some Ore was processed in late q4 2012 with expected grades. Currently awaiting
				permits to put into commercial production.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Lemhi Gold Trust</h3>
			<div class="boxSub3">
				<p class="initial">
				Canada based company, Norther Vertex and ISR have combined forces and made a commitment
				through a subsidiary to advance the Lemhi Gold Project into production through permitting. 
				The Lemhi Gold-Silver Project is located in the Dahlonega Mining District, Lemhi County,
				approximately 25km north of Salmon, Idaho. The Lemhi Gold property may contain over a million
				ounces of au equivalent a shear-hosted intrusive (porphyry)-related gold deposit hosted in 
				cataclasized quartzite and phyllite of the Mesoproterozoic Lemhi Group.
				</p>

			<h3 class="portfolio1">Montana</h3>
			<h3>Garnet</h3>
			<div class="boxSub">
				<p class="ray">
				The Garnet mine is located in Madison County, Montana. For centuries, garnet was used
				primarily as a semi-precious gemstone. Aside from the aesthetic beauty of this mineral,
				the angular fractures and high hardness of garnet has led to the stone becoming very desirable 
				for a variety of industrial applications. Major uses for garnet in the industrial sector include
				waterjet cutting, abrasive blasting media, water filtration and abrasive powders. According to the U.S. 
				Geological Survey Minerals Yearbook, worldwide industrial garnet demand is expected to grow over the
				next 5 years at a rate of 3-5 percent. While the United States is the worlds largest consumer of industrial 
				garnet, it only produces approximately 16 percent of the total garnet mined worldwide. The deposit hosts 
				a commercial garnet resource of several million tons averaging an approximate grade of 20% The current
				plan for the mine life is 20 years with an extension of an additional 20. It is currently 
				awaiting permitting approvals and is expected to be in Commercial Production this Season.
